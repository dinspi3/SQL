Importing CSV file into SQL table :
 Consider the given below CSV file or you can use your own csv file to perform this operation. 
Let us try to import a csv file into our SQL table in SQL Server.

Creating table –
Here. We will create the table schema as per csv file records.

USE [Test]--Database name

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Employee](                              
[Emp ID] bigint primary key,
[First Name] [varchar](50) NULL,
[Last Name] [varchar](50) NULL,
[Salary] bigint,
[City] [varchar](50)
)

Bulk Inserting –
Let’s now bulk insert the file into the Employee SQL table :

BULK INSERT [Test].[dbo].[Employee]
FROM 'C:\data\employee_data.csv'
WITH (FIRSTROW = 2,
    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
    ROWTERMINATOR='\n' );

The most commonly used input parameters are the following as follows.

FIELDTERMINATOR –‘
‘field_terminator’ is used as a separator between fields. The default field terminator is \t (tab character).
 
ROWTERMINATOR –
‘row_terminator’ is used to specify the end of the row. The default row terminator is \r\n (newline character).
